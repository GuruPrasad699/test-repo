                <h1>What Is Miyawaki Method?</h1>
                <div id="smile"></div>
                <p>The Miyawaki Method was invented by Japanese botanist and expert in plant ecology, Dr Akira Miyawaki. This Method is a unique innovative Potential Natural Vegetation concept, proven to work worldwide, irrespective of soil and climatic conditions. More than 3,000 forests have been successfully created worldwide using this methodology.
                    In this method, 3-5 saplings are planted per square meter with a minimum of 20-50 different species, creating a multi-layered green forest with no maintenance required after a 2-3 year period.</p>
